# OpenD

A docs platform where **"which release applies" and "who may see this" are one rule**. Authors write DITA in a Git repository. The build compiles it into a release snapshot that keeps every element's applicability, and each reader is served only what their release and entitlements allow.

This repository holds the first increment: the shared build and filter core, plus a local previewer. The hosted pieces (content store, webhook build, delivery service, entitlement service, web editor, PDF) come later and reuse these packages unchanged.

## Quick start

Requires Node 22.12+ and pnpm 10.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build

# Check the starter docs the same way CI does
pnpm opend validate templates/docs-starter

# Preview on http://127.0.0.1:4000, rebuilding on save
pnpm opend preview templates/docs-starter              # staff view: everything, conditions marked
pnpm opend preview templates/docs-starter --as v1-basic # as a reader from preview-contexts.yaml
pnpm opend preview templates/docs-starter --product widget,gadget --feature sso --version 2.1

# Write the release snapshot the hosted build would store
pnpm opend build templates/docs-starter --out release.json
```

The preview banner switches between reader contexts and lists any problems. `--ref v1` previews a release branch or tag without checking it out.

## How applicability works

Any map entry, topic or element can carry DITA filtering attributes:

| Attribute                                                       | Values                                   | A reader sees the content when               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `product`                                                       | tokens declared in `opend.config.yaml`   | they hold at least one listed product        |
| `feature`                                                       | tokens declared in `opend.config.yaml`   | they hold at least one listed feature        |
| `release`                                                       | `1.4`, `2`, `2.0..`, `..1.9`, `1.2..1.9` | their version matches at least one range     |
| `audience`, `platform`, `otherprops`, `props`, `deliveryTarget` | declared tokens                          | the build-time DITAVAL does not exclude them |

- Values within one attribute are OR'd. Separate attributes are AND'd. A rule on an ancestor (an element, topic, `topicref` or `topichead`) applies to everything inside it. These are DITAVAL semantics.
- Readers are **fail-closed**: a value they don't hold, an undeclared value or an unparseable range hides the content. `opend validate` reports undeclared values and bad ranges.
- Conditional key definitions work per reader. The first definition the reader's filter keeps wins, as DITA specifies.
- Links to a topic the reader can't see render as plain text and never reveal the target's title. Hidden pages return the same 404 as missing ones.

## Packages

| Package                                      | What it does                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`@opend/model`](packages/model)             | Shared types and schemas: node tree, project config, reader context, the `CompiledRelease` snapshot |
| [`@opend/filter`](packages/filter)           | **Pure** applicability filter: release ranges, reader and DITAVAL policies, filtered views          |
| [`@opend/dita`](packages/dita)               | DITA subset parser: topics, maps, keyspace, `conref` / `conkeyref` / `keyref`                       |
| [`@opend/build`](packages/build)             | Source tree (working tree or git ref) to `CompiledRelease`, with chunk-usage index                  |
| [`@opend/validate`](packages/validate)       | Every check, shared by CI, the CLI and the previewer                                                |
| [`@opend/render-html`](packages/render-html) | Filtered view to HTML pages and navigation                                                          |
| [`@opend/cli`](packages/cli)                 | `opend validate`, `opend build`, `opend preview`                                                    |

`templates/docs-starter` is the template repository teams start from. It contains sample topics, a map and a bookmap, reusable chunks, a brand theme, preview contexts and a validation workflow.

## Development

```sh
pnpm typecheck   # tsc -b across packages
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
pnpm test        # vitest, including the end-to-end leak test over the starter template
```

Tests run against TypeScript sources through the `source` export condition, so they need no build step. The CLI (`pnpm opend`) runs the compiled output, so run `pnpm build` first.
